                                                            instructions work step by step -

                               1. open aws-canvas.

                               AWS canvas   - choose -> 1. [CF]-Lab - Sandbox Environment.
                               2. start the lab.
                               3. verify you start the lab (green light in AWS (in the left upper side of the window)).
                               4. open AWS Details.
                               5. choose AWS CLI: show.
                               6. copy the default details of the lab (paste it to notepad).
                                     paste it like this --> Copy and paste the following into ~/.aws/credentials


                               2. open the ubuntu or your linux enverment. 

                               once it open - choose -> 
                               1. open your terminal.
                               2. once the terminal open write - sudo -i (enter your password to get inside the root).
                               3. verify that you are in root (you will see the name of root in the start).
                               4. in root --> write -> nano ~/.aws/credentials
                               5. in the nano ~/.aws/credentials file - write -
                                     paste the details from the notepad (AWS CLI: show)
                               6. save the nano file.


                               3. to verifty that you are in the aws cli via linux.

                               in the linux  - choose -> 
                               1. in the command line - we will check 1 parameter -
                                     
                                     - this command line will show Your VPCs -
                                          aws ec2 describe-vpcs --region us-west-2 --filters Name=isDefault,Values=true --query "Vpcs[0].VpcId" --output text
                                            copy the - VPC ID - (it will look like "vpc-xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx")


                               2. open a web page and go to - https://github.com/davidaws2/Project_Pokemon_api/blob/main/build_ec2.sh
                                          copy the code in -->  build_ec2.sh    -->  to your to your linux via nano or other program you use (git or visual studio).
                                          save the file as -->  build_ec2.sh    -->  in your linux (save it in a place that you know , we gonna use it later).
                                          
                                          change mode the file (it will give us the running option to the file)-->  build_ec2.sh 
                                            - write in your linux -
                                              chmod 744 build_ec2.sh
                                          
                               3. run the file build_ec2.sh in linux -
                                          ./build_ec2.sh


                               4. the ruuning file ./build_ec2.sh --> ask you to insert your VPC (you take it from the check VPCs in step 3.1 or you can see on the screen).
                                          enter the VPCs to the file

                               5. ./build_ec2.sh build a EC2 instance in AWS environment.
                                          is will show you the INSTANCE_NAME' and the status of running.
                                          it will give you the option to SSH into the instance.

                               6. Use the ssh option and connect to the instance that was created by the file ./build_ec2.sh.
                                          use the ssh connect to the instance.

                               7. you will get a message that ask you if you recognize the area and accecpt.
                                          choose yes to get in to the instance (just press yes).

                               8. now you are inside the new ec2 instance (the new EC2 instance that was create by the file ./build_ec2.sh)

                               9. check the file in the instance -
                                          write in the command line  ---> ls -la 
                                          it will list the files inside the instance

                               10. open a web page and go to - https://github.com/davidaws2/Project_Pokemon_api/blob/main/deploy.sh
                                          copy the code in -->  deploy.sh    -->  to your to your linux via nano or other program you use (git or visual studio).
                                          save the file as -->  deploy.sh    -->  in your linux (save it in a place that you know in the instance)
                                          
                                          to check the file exist --> write in the command line  ---> ls -la
                                          you need to see it in your files
                                          
                                          change mode the file (it will give us the running option to the file)--> deploy.sh  
                                            - write in your linux -  
                                              chmod 744 deploy.sh

                               11. run the file deploy.sh in linux -
                                          ./deploy.sh

                               12. once you running the deploy.sh file , few thing will happen -
                                          1. the system will update system packages.
                                          2. the system will install python3 and python3 pip.
                                          3. the system will install git and will upload files from https://github.com/davidaws2/Project_Pokemon_api
                                          4. the system will insatll requirements.txt.
                                          5. the system will run a python file name - pokiapi.py


                               13. pokiapi.py = the file ask you if you want to play and draw pokemon
                                       yes = draw a pokemon and show name , type and ability
                                       no  = exit from the game
                                       if the pokemon was draw in the past it will only show its details from the database

                               14. now in the instance will be a folder name - Project_Pokemon_api

                                       in this folder Project_Pokemon_api there is all the details from the upload https://github.com/davidaws2/Project_Pokemon_api

                               15. we create a database inside the instance
                                       the pokemon will be store in a database name --> pokemon_collection.json
                                       data base = pokemon_collection.json

                               16. to verfiy that you done eerything fine.
                                       write -  ls -la                     -------> verify that you see a folder name Project_Pokemon_api
                                       wrire - cd Project_Pokemon_api      -------> verify that you see a file name pokemon_collection.json

                                                            This is it , you done it !
